# SkillHub CLI

Manage and install skills for AI coding agents.

SkillHub is an enterprise-grade, self-hosted skill registry that enables teams to discover, share, and install reusable skills for AI coding agents like Claude Code. This CLI provides a seamless interface to interact with SkillHub registries.

### Using a custom registry

```bash

## 🌐 Registry

### Default registry

By default, the CLI connects to the public SkillHub registry at `https://skill.xfyun.cn`.

### Custom registry

Organizations can deploy their own private SkillHub instance. You can point the CLI to a custom registry:

**Per-command (recommended for one-time use):**
```bash
skillhub login --registry https://skillhub.yourcompany.com
```

**Shell-level default (persistent across commands):**

🐧 Linux/macOS:
```bash
export SKILLHUB_REGISTRY=https://skillhub.yourcompany.com
```

🪟 Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:SKILLHUB_REGISTRY="https://skillhub.yourcompany.com"
```

🪟 Windows CMD:
```cmd
set SKILLHUB_REGISTRY=https://skillhub.yourcompany.com
```

### Skill namespaces

Skills are namespaced by organization to prevent naming conflicts:

- `@astron-team/skill-name` - Skills from the Astron team
- `@yourorg/skill-name` - Skills from your organization

When installing skills, always include the full namespaced name.
